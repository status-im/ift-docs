# Build with Logos

<!-- This markdown file describes the landing page for the Logos technical documentation site ("Build") -->

## What is Logos

Logos is a modular stack that combines a blockchain for trustless agreements, decentralized storage, and an anonymous communication layer. Logos consolidates previously separate efforts (Nomos, Codex, Waku) under one public identity to reduce cognitive load and provide a coherent developer experience.

To learn more about Logos, visit the [Logos main site](https://logos.co/).

## Documentation status and timeline

We are consolidating and updating previously fragmented materials into a single, coherent developer experience and source of truth, featuring consistent navigation and terminology. This process is ongoing, and we appreciate your patience as we work to provide comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.

We are also unifying public naming in our documentation to reflect Logos as a single technical stack: Nomos → Logos Blockchain, Codex → Logos Storage, and Waku → Logos Connect. This consolidation makes the architecture easier to navigate by aligning documentation, examples, and terminology under one scheme. Legacy names may still appear in repositories and specifications, but going forward the Logos-first names will be used across our docs.

Our aim is to provide a predictable onboarding path for operators and developers, where they can find what they need and trust what they read.

### What to expect next

Starting in 2026, we will release documentation in phases aligned with the project milestones.

We will provide operator guides for those who want to run and support the Logos Blockchain, and developer guides for contributors building decentralized applications on the Logos stack (blockchain, storage, communications). This page will be updated as sections go live; timelines may adjust as the system evolves.

We will update this page as sections go live and contribution paths open, and timelines may adjust as the system evolves.

### How to follow progress and contribute

We will publish milestones and changelogs on this page as sections go live. If you are a developer interested in early testing or contributing documentation, watch this space for contribution pathways as they become available.

## Existing resources

While we work on consolidating our documentation, you can find existing technical resources here:

- [Logos Blockchain (formerly, Nomos)](https://nomos-tech.notion.site/project)
- [Logos Connect (formerly, Waku)](https://docs.waku.org/)

> Note
>
> Codex’s previous documentation has been phased out. The new Logos Storage documentation will be published here when ready. To stay updated, join the [Codex Discord community](https://discord.gg/pSDRYRbGHV).
