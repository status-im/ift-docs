# Icons and emojis

- When referring to user interface elements with an icon, use the same icon to guide the user's actions. This rule applies to text in procedural steps or outside of procedural steps.
- Write the icon first, and then the name of the icon in bold typeface. If the icon displays a label in the UI, use that label.
- Except for callout types, don't use emojis in your document.
