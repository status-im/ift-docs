# Admonitions

- IFT documentation uses three different types of admonitions (also known as *callouts*):

    | Admonition | Description |
    |:-----------|:------------|
    | **Tip**    | Helpful information that is not required for the task, such as a keyboard shortcut. |
    | **Note**   | Relevant information for completing the task, but does not affect the user's actions. |
    | **Caution**| Information that may impact the user's actions or decisions about completing the task. |

- Don't use *warning*, *error*, *danger*, *bug*, *important*, or *notes*.
- In procedures, place the admonition after the procedure, unless it contains critical information for a specific step. In that case, you can place it directly within the procedure.
- For other content, add the admonition after the relevant information.
