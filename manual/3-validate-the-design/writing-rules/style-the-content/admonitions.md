# Admonitions

- Logos documentation uses three different types of callouts:

    | Callout | Description |
    |:-----------|:------------|
    | **Tip**    | Helpful information that is not required for the task, such as a keyboard shortcut. |
    | **Note**   | Relevant information for completing the task, but does not affect the user's actions. |
    | **Important**| Information that may impact the user's actions or decisions about completing the task. |
    | **Caution**| Information that may impact the user's actions or decisions about completing the task. |

- Don't use *warning*, *error*, *danger*, *bug*, *important*, or *notes*.
- In procedural steps, place the callout after the procedure. If you need an admonition for a specific step, write the admonition after the step.
- For other content, add the callout after the relevant information.
