# Titles

- Use the rules described in the [Structure the content](../10-structure-the-content/_index.md) section for each document type.
- Use meaningful titles that provide a precise idea of the article's content.

    | Usage     | Example |
    |:----------|:--------|
    | **Correct** | Upload a file using Codex  |
    | Incorrect   | Upload a file    |
    | Incorrect   | Uploading a file using Codex   |

- Adhere to the [capitalization convention](./capitalization.md).
- Don't use colons (:) in titles.
- The title of your article determines the Markdown file name:
    - Use the title of the article in all-lowercase letters for the Markdown file name.
    - Use a dash symbol ("-") to replace spaces.
    - Don't exclude articles, prepositions, or any other word in the Markdown file name.
    - If the name includes apostrophes, remove them from the Markdown file name. If the apostrophe is part of the possessive form with an extra *s* letter, separate the letter in the name (example: `transfer-you-community-s-ownership`).
