This section describes the most common style elements and conventions in the Status user documentation. The goal is to simplify the writer's workflow using unambiguous guidelines that are easy to remember and follow.

For most of our style conventions, you can find both the *correct* and *incorrect* use examples in this guide. In many cases, the *incorrect* examples are valid and commonly used sentences in English. They're incorrect only in the context of this style guide and the Status technical documentation.

We prioritize simplicity over comprehensiveness. If you can't find a particular style convention, use the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). If you think a style convention is missing, you can contribute to this guide.
