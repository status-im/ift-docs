# Checkbox lists

Use a [numbered list](./numbered-lists.md) for steps that the user can finish in one continuous session. Use a checkbox list for items that may be started, paused, and resumed later (for example, when you must wait days or weeks before the next action).

  ✅ Item 1<br>✅ Item 2<br>✅ Item 3
