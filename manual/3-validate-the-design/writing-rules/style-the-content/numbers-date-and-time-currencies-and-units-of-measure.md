> There isn't a common notation for thousand and decimal separators and notation varies among different countries. In the United States, the decimal separator is a period (.) and the thousands separator is a comma (,). In Germany, the decimal separator is a comma (,) and the thousands separator is a period (.). In Sweden, the thousands separator is a space.
