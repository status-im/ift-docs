# Modal verbs

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that modify the meaning of the main verb in a sentence. Modal verbs can be problematic in technical communication:

- Some modal verbs create a sense of uncertainty in readers.
- Using modal verbs like *should* or *must* can make your tone sound bossy and less helpful. In many cases, using the imperative is a better option. For example:

    | Tone          | Example                                      |
    |:--------------|:---------------------------------------------|
    | **Assertive** | Save your seed phrase in a secure location.  |
    | Bossy         | You should save your seed phrase in a secure location. |

    | **can**              | Use to express the possibility for the user to do something, such as introducing a new concept or functionality.<br>Example: You can create multiple wallets for different purposes. |
    | **should**           | If possible, use the imperative form of the verb instead.                                                                                       |
    | **have to**          | Use *must* instead.                                                                                                                             |
    | **must**             | Use very selectively and only when it is strictly necessary for the user to do something to avoid data or funds loss, data corruption, or unintended information disclosure. |
    | **could, would, might** | Don't use.                                                                                                                                   |
