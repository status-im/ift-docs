- Avoid long [noun phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase). If you use a noun phrase, don't use more than one modifier. Use the *of* preposition to simplify noun phrases.

    | Usage      | Example                                      |
    |:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|

- Keep adjectives and adverbs immediately before the word they modify. Pay close attention to *only* and *not*.

    | Usage      | Example                                 |
    |:-----------|:----------------------------------------|
    | **Correct**   | You can access your messages only after 30 days. |
    | Incorrect  | You can only access your messages after 30 days.    |

- In the first paragraph after a heading, avoid repeating the title information. For example, if the heading title is "Search for a contact using the Status display name," don't start the first paragraph with "To search for a contact using the Status display name [...]"
- Lookup for instances of the *which* word on your text; it's possible you can replace them with *that*. For more information about the differences between *which* and *that*, check out this [Grammarly article](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/which-vs-that/).
