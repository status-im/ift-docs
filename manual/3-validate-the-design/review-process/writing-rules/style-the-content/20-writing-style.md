# Writing style

- Address the user using *you* or *your*.
- Use the active voice to emphasize that the action is on the user, not the software. Sometimes a passive sentence is unavoidable, and that's OK.

    | Usage       | Example                                                                 |
    |:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Correct** | Click Block User to block messages from the user.                      |
    | Incorrect   | The Block User option must be selected to block messages from the user. |

- Write in the present tense. Avoid using the future tense or variations of the present tense, such as the present perfect tense.
