# Troubleshooting

A troubleshooting topic explains to users the product's known issues and errors they might encounter due to product quirks or user mistakes. It provides effective solutions when available, or clarifies the situation when a solution is not immediately possible.

A troubleshooting document can address different complexities within a defined scope. A document can detail:

- A known issue without a solution or workaround
- One issue with one solution
- A collection of issues with the same symptom but different causes
- A collection of related issues and corresponding solutions

When an issue applies to a specific procedure article, and you can explain it within 2 100-word paragraphs, document it in that article as a [troubleshooting section](../procedure/procedure-template-flat.md#faq-troubleshooting-optional).
