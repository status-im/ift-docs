# Troubleshooting

A troubleshooting topic explains to users the product known issues and errors they might encounter because of product quirks or users' mistakes, and helps users resolve issues effectively if there is a solution.

A troubleshooting document can address different complexities within a defined scope. Specifically, a document can detail:

- One issue with one solution
- One issue with multiple solutions due to different causes
- A collection of related issues

When an issue applies to a specific procedure article, and you can explain it within 2 100-word paragraphs, document it in that article as a [troubleshooting section](../procedure/procedure-template-flat.md#faq-troubleshooting-optional).
