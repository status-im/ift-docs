(1) Nest code and images inside the list item they clarify (indent so they are children of the preceding step).
(2) Use checkboxes only for unordered or long-running tasks. Numbered lists are the default for procedures.  
(3) Use a short bullet list for clarifiers or alternatives. Do not create numbered sub-steps.

## Solution intro

Use the Overview section to expain whether there is a solution. If there is a solution to the issue, use the other sections to help readers understand the underlying mechanism of the fix. 

The introduction includes these sections, each one represented by a paragraph, list, or table:

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Decisions (optional)](#decisions-optional)
- [Limits (optional)](#limits-optional)
- [Prerequisites (optional)](#prerequisites-optional)

### Overview <!-- group: TS-SOLUTION-OVERVIEW -->

### Decisions (optional) <!-- group: TS-SOLUTION-DECISIONS -->

- Summarize decisions the reader must make **before** starting (for example, CLI vs. GUI). <!-- TS-BEHAV-SOLUTION-DECISIONS-PURPOSE -->
- Use a list for simple choices; use a compact table for multi-factor comparisons. <!-- TS-BEHAV-SOLUTION-DECISIONS-FORM -->
- Focus on actionable factors: performance, complexity, cost, prerequisites, and limitations. <!-- TS-BEHAV-SOLUTION-DECISIONS-FACTORS -->
- State trade-offs explicitly (for example, "A is faster but less secure"). <!-- TS-BEHAV-SOLUTION-DECISIONS-TRADEOFFS -->
- Give clear guidance (for example, "Choose A if you need X; choose B if you need Y"). <!-- TS-BEHAV-SOLUTION-DECISIONS-GUIDANCE -->

### Limits (optional) <!-- group: TS-SOLUTION-LIMITS -->
