# Reference

Use a reference article when you need to provide a clear and structured place to lookup information quickly, without having to read a full explanation or step-by-step instructions.

In many cases, a reference article supports users as they perform a task (for example, by providing a list of error messages and their meanings). In other cases, a reference article works independently, providing users with a place to look up specific information (for example, a list of keyboard shortcuts).

> Users generally don't read reference articles from start to finish. Instead, they scan the content to find the specific information they need.

These are classic examples of reference articles:

- API endpoint summary (path, method, request parameters, response codes)
- CLI command reference (command syntax, options, examples)
- Configuration file options (for example, the `config.yaml` reference)
- Error codes and their meanings
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Permissions and role matrix
- Hardware specifications table

## When to use a reference article

Use a reference article when you need to answer questions like:

- What are all the available options?
- What does each field/parameter/flag do?
- What values are allowed?
- What are the default settings?
- What error codes can appear and what do they mean?
- What are the keyboard shortcuts or CLI commands?

When in doubt about whether to use a reference article, consider this information:

| Choose Reference when… | Choose something else when… |
|:---|:---|
| The information is best presented as a list or table (parameters, flags, environment variables, status codes, error messages) | You need to explain why something works or teach a broader concept → use Concept |
| Users will search or scan for a specific item | You are teaching a sequence of actions → use Procedure |
| The content is mostly static and changes infrequently | The content is primarily narrative or explanatory → use Concept |
| You have many small, related items that share the same structure (name + description + default + allowed values, and so on) | You have only one or two items → a short paragraph in a Procedure or Concept is usually enough |
| You want the page to be easy to maintain when new items are added (just add a row or list item) | The items require long explanations or screenshots → consider Concept or separate detailed pages |
