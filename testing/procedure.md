# Procedure

A procedure is a goal-oriented document that describes how to complete an action using a series of steps. Procedures help readers use and discover your project features and are the core of our user documentation. These are the main characteristics of procedures:

- Two parts make up a procedure. The first part includes reference (non-procedural) information, while the second part includes procedural information.
- Non-procedural descriptions must be short and to the point. If the functionality requires further discussion, use an additional [concept article](#concept-help-me-to-understand).
- A procedure explains one or more related tasks and, if necessary, additional subtasks. If a task is complex, consider splitting it into different procedures documents.
- For tasks that may cause an error (for example, changing a password, choosing a username, or sending crypto), consider adding a *Common questions* section at the end of the article, with answers to the most common issues. If the list of possible errors for a specific task is too long, use a linked Troubleshooting or [FAQ](#concept-help-me-to-understand) (concept) article instead.
- If the user can complete the procedure in one go, use a numbered list to describe the steps. Use checkboxes if the user can't complete the procedure in one go or the steps don't follow a particular order. For example, if the user must complete the steps over several days or weeks, or if each step corresponds to an entire procedure you describe elsewhere.
