# Numbered lists

- When reading instructions, users understand numbered lists as actions to complete orderly. Because of this, limit the numbered lists to procedural instructions in procedure topics.
- If you must use a numbered list outside of a procedure, use the same rules described for bullet lists.
- Use "1." for all items in a numbered list. This ensures the list renders correctly and simplifies reordering.
