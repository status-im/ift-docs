# Links

Use links to other articles in the IFT documentation, but don't abuse links. For example, don't make the topic look like a Wikipedia article with a link in every sentence.

- Limit the links for sources outside the IFT documentation.
- Don't use links in procedural steps, except when you link to a subtask in the same article.
- In general, write the link without using the URL. If you must use the URL, omit the `https://` and the `www` parts of the URL (if the website allows this).
- Don't hide the linked content using the words _here_ or _this_. Instead, write out the content you link.

    |:------------|:------------------------------|
    | **Correct** | For more details about tokens, check out **Understand Status tokens**. |

- When pointing the user to external sources, start you sentence with *For more details*.
