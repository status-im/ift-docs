- Adhere to the capitalization convention described in this article.
- Your article's title determines the Markdown file name:
    - Use the article's title in all-lowercase letters for the Markdown file name.
    - Use a dash symbol ("-") to replace spaces.
    - Don't exclude articles, prepositions, or any other word in the Markdown file name.
    - If the name includes apostrophes, remove them from the Markdown file name. If the apostrophe is part of the possesive form with an extra *s* letter, separate the letter in the name (example: `transfer-you-community-s-ownership`).
