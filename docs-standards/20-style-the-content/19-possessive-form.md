# Possessive form

- Use the possessive form with caution and avoid complex possessive forms like the [compound possessive](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/possessive-case/). Some non-native English readers may have problems understanding sentences with possessive forms.

    | Usage     | Example |
    |:----------|:--------|
    | **Correct** | [...] your contact's status. |
    | Incorrect   | your contact's verified status.    |
    | **Correct** | [...] the verified status of the contact. |
    | **Correct** | [...] the picture shared by you and your trusted contact. |
    | Incorrect   | [...] you and your trusted contact's shared picture.    |

- Use a single straight quotation mark (') apostrophe. Don't use curly quotation marks (also known as smart quotes.)
- If you have to use a passive form with a proper name ending with the possessive *s*, add the apostrophe at the end without an extra *s* letter.

    | Usage     | Example |
    |:----------|:--------|
    | **Correct** | Check your contacts' list. |
    | Incorrect   | Check your contacts's list.    |

- If the possessor is not a person, you don't need to add an apostrophe to show possession.

    | Usage     | Example |
    |:----------|:--------|
    | **Correct** | Verify the contact's ENS name on the Status details screen. |
    | Incorrect   | Verify the contact's ENS name on the Status' details screen.    |
    | **Correct** | Your profile information stays in your browser cache. |
    | Incorrect   | Your profile information stays in your browser's cache.    |
