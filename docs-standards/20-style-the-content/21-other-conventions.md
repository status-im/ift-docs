# Other style conventions

- Use everyday language. Don't use jargon, technicalities, flowery or made-up words, or wordy constructions. Write as if you're talking to a client on a sync: don't be too casual but remember to sound human.
- Use verbs instead of nouns wherever possible. Rephrase the sentence if necessary. Verbs bring dynamics and help keep the reader engaged.
- It's OK to repeat important information throughout the text.
- Use gender-neutral language. Don't use _he_ and _she,_ _him_ or _her_, _he/she_ or similar. Instead, use _they_ and neutral nouns like _user_, _administrator_, or _content creator_. Use the plural form wherever possible.
- Use the same word for the same concept consistently. Avoid using synonyms to refer to the same idea or feature.
- Use _log in to_ and _sign in to_, not _log into_ or _sign into_.
- Treat the word _data_ as a plural noun. For example, "Your Status profile data are temporarily stored on the Waku network".
- Don't use _we recommend..._ or _Status recommends..._. Recommendations create doubts in the reader's mind. Instead, explain to users what to do and, if necessary, the consequences of doing or not doing it.
- Don't use _please_ in technical documentation. Readers look for assertiveness when reading instructions.
- Don't try to be funny, express emotions with exclamation marks, or ask readers rhetorical questions. Users are not interested in reading prose but in getting things done.

- It's OK to use prepositions at the end of sentences (for example, _the user you're searching for_).
- Don't use italics or quotes to introduce a new concept; in general, don't use them on any part of the text (except when writing about UI elements that use italics or quotes.)
- Use code formatting to distinguish parameters or options from the rest of your text when discussing them outside of procedure steps.
