# Bullet lists

- Don't use a bullet list for actions that users should complete in an orderly manner; use numbered lists in procedures.
- Use a bullet list to improve the readability of sentences or paragraphs where you list or describe three or more items.

    | Usage      | Example                                                                                           |

    | **Correct**| You need a machine running Ubuntu Linux with the following minimum requirements:<br>- 4 GB memory<br>- 2 TB SSD<br>- Linux 64-bit |
    | Incorrect  | You need a machine running Ubuntu Linux with the following minimum requirements: 4 GB memory, 2 TB SSD, and Linux 64-bit. |
    | Incorrect  | You need a machine with 4 GB of memory, a 2 TB SSD, and a 64-bit Ubuntu Linux operating system.  |

- Use a colon (:) before the bullet list items.
- Use periods at the end of each sentence in a bullet list for [punctuation](./05-punctuation-and-symbols.md). Using periods on a bullet list can be tricky. Use the following guidelines:
    - When the list items are complete sentences, use a period at the end of each sentence.
    - Don't use a period when the list items are not complete sentences or sentences with three words or less.
    - In a list with elements of more and less than three words mixed, don't use a period.
- Don't use colons after each item on a list; type the item definition on a new line. Here are some examples of using punctuation on a list:

> When you need to describe each element on a list and you have more than three elements, consider using a table instead.
