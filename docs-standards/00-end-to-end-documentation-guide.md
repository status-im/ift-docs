# End-to-end-documentation guide

This guide is for the subject-matter experts (SMEs) who build our products: the developers, infrastructure engineers, and other technical contributors responsible for designing and implementing features. It is written for technical experts who need to produce clear, effective documentation for the solutions they create, but who are not professional technical writers.

Our core assumption is that the primary barrier to writing documentation is not a lack of willingness, but the lack of a clear and repeatable process. This guide provides that process. It is designed to remove the guesswork, eliminate "blank page" anxiety, and give you a straightforward workflow to create high-quality documentation consistently.

## How this guide is organized

This document provides a high-level overview of the entire documentation workflow, presented as a sequence of five distinct stages: task analysis, good-enough first draft, review and refinement, and publication. It is designed to be a map that you can use to navigate the process from an initial idea to a final, published document.

This document does not contain exhaustive details. Instead, it functions as a central hub, providing direct links to the specific templates, checklists, writing rules, and external tools required to complete each step of the process. You can use it as a quick reference to find the resources you need for a specific task.

## The documentation workflow

This guide provides an end-to-end overview of the documentation process, from initial analysis to final publication. Use it to understand each part of the workflow and how they connect.

## Task analysis

| Element | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Description | (1) Identify and decompose SME's goal</br>(2) Combine topics into documents |
| Goal | Define scope and structure before writing to ensure alignment with SME's goal |
| Input | Feature code, user stories, and any other existing documentation |
| Output | The name of the document(s) that describes the feature with basic headings 2 (H2) outline |
| Tools | - Task analysis guide</br>- Topic combination rules |


## Good-enough first draft

| Element | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Description | Create a good-enough first draft (9) by prompting (6) an LLM (3) with relevant context (4, 5, 7) and examples (8). |
| Goal | Reduce the time required to document new features by supporting the process with LLMs |
| Input | - The H2 outline from the task analysis stage.</br>- Contextual information (4, 5, 7).</br>- Writing rules and examples (8). |
| Output | A "good-enough" first draft (9) of the document(s) generated by the LLM. |
| Tools | LLM (3).</br>- A pre-defined prompt (6). |

## Review and refinement

| Element | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Description | Review the good-enough first draft (9) using the review checklist (10). Refine it by self-review (11) and incorporating feedback to create the final documents (12) |
| Goal | Improve the quality and completeness of the documentation before final delivery. |
| Input | Good-enough first draft (9). |
| Output | The final version of the document(s) that describes the feature with a comprehensive outline and detailed content. |
| Tools | - Review checklist</br>- Feedback collection via GitHub pull request |

## Publication

| Element | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Description | Publish the final version of the document(s) in the table of contents. |
| Goal | Make the documentation publicly available and easily discoverable. |
| Input | Final version of the document(s) (12). |
| Output | Published documentation that is accessible to users. |
| Tools | - Content model</br>- Documentation publishing platform |
