# Concept - Help me to understand

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> For the template associated to this topic, see [concept template](../../../templates/concept/concept-template.md).

Concept topics build the mental model behind a feature or product. They explain the "why" so users can understand the purpose and benefits of the feature. For example, a developer starting with Waku might need to understand the concept of "Waku nodes" before they can effectively use the Waku protocol.

Concepts provide non-procedural information that complements other topic types, such as [procedure](./procedure-help-me-to-do.md) or [reference](./reference-help-me-to-remember.md) topics, but never replaces or duplicates them.

## When to use a concept topic

Create a concept topic whenever readers must understand background knowledge before:

- Using a feature or product
- Implementing an integration
- Choosing between alternative options
- Understand non-obvious behavior

> A list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) falls under the concept category.

## Writing a concept topic

### Filenames

Check out the [file names and location rules](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#file-names-and-location-rules) for more information.

### General rules

- Target for documents between 900 and 1 500 words. Split longer ideas into separate concept topics.
- Replace dense prose with [lists](../../20-style-the-content/06-bullet-lists.md) and [tables](../../20-style-the-content/08-tables.md) to improve readability.
- Richly [link](../../20-style-the-content/10-links.md) to related topics, especially procedure and reference topics.
- Include [diagrams or images](../../30-work-with-media/_index.md) to illustrate complex ideas or workflows.

> ☝️ **Tip:**
>
> In Visual Studio Code, use the [Live Word Count](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Taptic.live-word-count) ↗ extension  that is part of the recommended repository extensions.

## Concept topic structure

Concept topics follow a specific structure to ensure consistency and clarity. This table outlines the required elements, their formats, and dependencies:

### Title

Concepts titles should explain, not instruct. They should be descriptive and concise (no more than 60 characters), indicating the main idea of the concept.

Guidelines:

1. Use cue words such as `Guide to`, `About`, `Understand`, `FAQ`, or `Introduction to`. Do not use active verbs like `Learn` or `How to`.
2. For verbs, use the base form over the gerund form. For example, use `Understand` instead of `Understanding`.
3. Start with `About` to signal background reading. Avoid gerunds that look like procedures.
4. Use the `FAQ:` prefix for question compilations. Don't phrase FAQs as tasks.
5. When none of the cue words fit, choose a concise noun phrase.

| Rule | Usage         | ⚙️ Example                        |
|:-----|:--------------|:---------------------------------|
|  1   | **Correct**   | *Guide to RLN rate limiting*     |
|      | Incorrect     | *RLN rate limiting*              |
|  2   | **Correct**   | *Understand Codex API limits*    |
|      | Incorrect     | *Understanding Codex API limits* |
|  3   | **Correct**   | *About Waku GossipSub relay*     |
|      | Incorrect     | *Running Waku GossipSub relay*   |
|  4   | **Correct**   | *FAQ: Codex billing*             |
|      | Incorrect     | *Billing with Codex*             |
|  5   | **Correct**   | *Waku message encryption layers* |
|      | Incorrect     | *Encrypt messages in Waku*       |

### Subtitle

One short, imperative sentence that (a) defines the topic in plain language and (b) states the primary benefit or outcome. It answers the reader’s silent question, "Why should I care?".

Guidelines:

- Single sentence with no links, list items, or formatting. Ends with a period.
- Use H4 format. Stay under 120 characters / 20 words.
- Use imperative verbs to describe the topic's purpose or benefit: *Learn*, *Explore*, *Understand*, *Discover*, and so on.
- Adds new value beyond the title. It should not repeat the title or be a rephrased version of it.

> ⚙️ **Example:**
>
>- *Understand Waku’s peer-to-peer protocol for private, censorship-resistant messaging.*
>- *Learn how Codex provides real-time blockchain data through a single API.*

### Admonition (optional)

This information-type [admonition](../../20-style-the-content/12-admonitions.md) is exclusively to alert readers about who can use this feature and shouldn't be used for any other information. For example, a feature is only available to specific application role or using a specific tool or interface.

> ⚙️ **Example:**
>
> *This feature is available to users with the **Admin** role in the application.*

### Introduction

Guidelines:

- Start with one or two lead sentences in a single paragraph that explains the concept, its purpose, and its relevance. This lead should be concise and engaging, ideally no more than 50 words.
- After the lead, explain the concept's main points using one paragraph per idea.
- If necessary, provide context or background information to help readers understand the concept.
- Link to related topics or headers in the same document to support the reader's gathering of information.

> ⚙️ **Example:**
>
>*Codex uses erasure coding and zero‑knowledge proofs to ensure stored data remains available and tamper‑proof in a fully decentralized network. This makes it safe and reliable for long‑term storage of critical information—without relying on any single provider.*
>
>*Erasure coding breaks each file into redundant fragments so that data can be reconstructed even if some nodes go offline, while ZK-based proofs provide lightweight verification that nodes are still storing their pieces, without revealing the data itself. Codex augments this with a lazy‑repair mechanism that restores missing fragments efficiently and an incentive‑driven marketplace where nodes stake collateral to back their storage promises—slashing misbehaving nodes and rewarding reliable ones.*

### Diagram or image (optional)

This section is part of the introduction and doesn't use a heading.

Guidelines:

- Use one diagram or image per concept. If you need two, the concept needs splitting or the second visual belongs to alater H2 section.
- To show an architecture, flow, or process, use a Mermaid diagram.
- For UI or CLI outputs, when the interface itself is the concept, use a screenshot or image.
- For simple relationships, use a Mermaid diagram. Even two boxes and an arrow is clearer than prose.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> For more information, check out the [diagrams](../../30-work-with-media/03-diagrams.md#mermaid-diagrams) and [screenshots](../../30-work-with-media/02-screenshots.md) information.

### Use case example (optional)

This section is part of the introduction and doesn't use a heading.

Provide a concrete, real-world scenario for the product feature. It answers the reader's silent question, "How can I use this feature in my work?" Use a bullet list format to present multiple use cases clearly.

> ⚙️ **Example:**
>
> *For example, you can configure custom environment variables so they are set every time you open a codespace, and you can ensure that temporary files are retained when the codespace stops.*

### Comparison (optional)

This section is part of the introduction and doesn't use a heading.

Use this section to help readers choose the right option among alternatives. This is specially useful when the concept has different implementations.

Guidelines:

- Use a list for simple comparisons or a table for more complex ones.
- Focus on key decision factors, such as performance, complexity, cost, prerequisites, and limitations.
- Use direct language in short sentences so different options are easy to scan.
- Highlight trade‑offs clearly. For example, "Option A is faster but less secure" or "Option B adds encryption overhead".
- Provide real-world guidance. For example, "Choose A if you need X, choose B if you care about Y".

> ⚙️ **Example:**
>
> | Feature             | Relay                                         | RLN Relay                                         |
> |:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
> | Spam protection     | None – all peers can flood messages           | Enforces per-peer rate limits, economic penalties |
> | Privacy impact      | Neutral – standard Pub/Sub propagation        | Neutral – preserves Relay’s anonymity properties  |
> | Resource guarantees | Relies on network-level quotas, no enforcement| Stronger resilience due to rate limiting          |

### `The basics` section

This section provides a high-level overview of the concept, covering the most important takeaways without going into detail. Each point should be a concise statement that captures the essence of the concept.

Guidelines:

- Use `The basics` H2 heading for this section.
- Write a single unordered list with three bullet points that summarize the concept.
- Order the points from most important to least important.
- Aim for one sentence per bullet point, maximum two very short ones.

> ⚙️ **Example:**
>
>- *Codespaces are fully managed, cloud-based development environments you can spin up in seconds.*
>- *They run in containers that match your repository’s configuration, so every contributor gets the same setup.*  
>- *You connect from your browser, VS Code, or the JetBrains Gateway. No local installation required.*

### H2-H4 sections

Headings structure the content into logical sections. Use H2 for key concepts, H3 for subconcepts, and H4 for further subdivisions if necessary.

Guidelines:

- One heading = one concept. Don't mix two ideas under the same heading.
- Arrange H2 sections from general to specific, or from most important to least important.
- Start with a paragraph before you add lists or tables.
- When possible, limit the document depth to H3.
- Stop at H4. Deeper levels (H5, H6) are forbidden.
- If you add an H3, at least one sibling H3 must follow or the split is unnecessary.

#### Using headings to organize content

Each heading level answers one question:

| Heading | Answers the question...                                        | Content to include                                                                                             |
|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H2      | What is the main concept I need to understand first?           | The core concept, such as Architecture, Security Model, or Lifecycle.                                              |
| H3      | What are the key components or behaviors of this concept?      | (Optional) Sub-concepts that relate only to the parent H2.                                                     |
| H4      | Are there specific details or edge cases within this subtopic? | (Optional) Use when an H3 contains two or more distinct pieces of information that need further splitting. |

Quick decision tree for section headings:

```markdown
Need to add a section?
├─ Is it a brand-new core concept?             → H2
├─ Is it part of an existing H2 concept?       → H3
└─ Is it a detail that splits an H3 concept?   → H4 (and only if unavoidable)
```

⚙️ **Example:**

```markdown
## Architecture
{ Paragraph }

### Components
- Compute host  
- Container image  
- Virtual file system  

### Networking
{ Paragraph }

#### Port forwarding rules   <-- only because Networking had two separate cases
{ Paragraph }
```

### Further reading (forbidden)

This section is forbidden in concept topics. Instead, link to related procedure or reference topics within the content.
