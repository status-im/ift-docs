Unified, AI-ready framework for IFT's user documentation

--- #3

# Current Documentation Pain Points

- **Fragmented toolchain**: Multiple documentation tools and workflows lead to inefficiencies.
- **Uneven content quality**: Inconsistent documentation standards across projects.
- **Unclear onboarding**: New contributors struggle to understand where to start.
- **Missing key information**: Important concepts are often buried or not documented at all.
- **Lack of standards**: No unified structure for documentation, making it hard for writers to write and users to browse the docs.
- **Diluted ownership**: Docs are treated as a side task, with no clear accountability.

# Proposed Solution: Unified Documentation Framework

image

--- #5

# What means "Unified Platform"?

Consolidate all user-facing documentation for IFT projects onto a single, AI-native platform, specifically GitBook, to provide a central access point for users.

--- #6

# What means "Unified workflow"?

Establish a standardized workflow for creating and updating documentation using a "docs-as-code" model, with content stored in a single GitHub monorepository, to improve quality and facilitate contributions.

--- #7

# Federated ownership model

Define clear roles and responsibilities, including a project lead (technical writer) and dedicated documentation owners within each IFT unit, to ensure accountability for content creation and maintenance.

Documentation owners will continue to report to their respective team leads, ensuring that writers for each team are managed by their own team and not by the project lead. This federated model aims to avoid a centralized "IFT Docs" department.

â¬¥ Once only
â­‘ Once per IFT unit

--- #9

# Out of scope

- Adapting existing docs â­‘ -- Update the existing documentation to follow standards
- Implementing analytics â­‘ -- Configure GitBook analytics, prioritizing users' privacy

â­‘ Once per IFT unit

While phases 11 and 12 are outside the direct scope of this project, we will provide the necessary support to facilitate their implementation.
